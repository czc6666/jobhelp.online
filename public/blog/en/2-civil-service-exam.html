                    <p>Hello everyone, welcome to my guide on employment in central and state-owned enterprises. I'm Doudou.</p>
                    <p>In the previous session, we discussed the importance of career planning. Starting from this lesson, we will analyze different career paths in detail to help you make a more suitable choice. Today, let's talk about the path of "taking the civil service exam," analyze its current situation, pros and cons, and discuss whether you are suitable and how to prepare.</p>
                    <h3>Current Situation of the Civil Service Exam: "Involution" in a Word</h3>
                    <p>The "civil service fever" is no longer news; it trends on social media every time an exam is held. Let's first look at some data to get a direct sense of the current level of competition.</p>
                    <p>Taking the first half of this year as an example, Guizhou Province planned to recruit 4,658 people, but the final number of applicants reached a staggering 330,000, meaning over 325,000 people will not be selected. Even in regions with relatively less competition like Gansu and Hunan, the number of applicants reached 120,000 and 140,000, respectively. And this is often not the final number, as many candidates are accustomed to registering on the last day.</p>
                    <p>Comparing the data from the last two years, the number of applicants in most provinces continues to rise. Even if the number of applicants in some areas (like Yunnan and Zhejiang) seems to have decreased, the main reason is that the number of vacancies was halved, while the number of applicants did not decrease proportionally, making the actual competition even more intense.</p>
                    <p>Besides the fierce competition, the difficulty of the exam is also increasing. A few years ago, in regions with a total score of 200, 120 points might have gotten you into the interview stage; now, you might not even reach the interview threshold without 140 points. A large number of applicants and high admission scores—this is the true picture of the current "involution" in the civil service exam.</p>
                    <h3>Why So "Involutional"?</h3>
                    <p>Behind the "civil service fever," there are four main reasons:</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li><strong>Impact of the Pandemic</strong>: The pandemic has impacted a large number of enterprises, with many companies facing the risk of bankruptcy and employees facing increased risk of unemployment. The stability of civil service positions has become prominent at this time, attracting a large number of professionals to join the ranks of exam takers.</li>
                        <li><strong>Pursuit of Stability</strong>: In an uncertain economic environment, the "iron rice bowl" attribute of government jobs—never losing your job and having a stable income—has a huge appeal to job seekers.</li>
                        <li><strong>Difficulty in Graduate Employment</strong>: The number of graduates is increasing year by year, while the number of available jobs in society has not grown synchronously, leading many graduates to be "unemployed upon graduation." Taking the civil service exam has become an important way out.</li>
                        <li><strong>Parental Expectations</strong>: "Getting into the system" is the expectation of many parents for their children. Under the guidance of their parents, many young people without clear plans have also embarked on the path of taking the civil service exam.</li>
                    </ol>
                    <h3>The "Pros" and "Cons" of Being a Civil Servant</h3>
                    <p>Although the path to civil service is full of challenges, the "perks" after successfully getting in are undeniable.</p>
                    <h4>What are the "Pros"?</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Job Security, the renowned "Iron Rice Bowl"</strong>: You never have to worry about layoffs or pay cuts, and you can rest easy even during an economic crisis.</li>
                        <li><strong>High Status and a Decent Job</strong>: The work environment is excellent, without the hardships of being exposed to the elements. In the eyes of elders, this is a highly respected profession, and it can even bring convenience to your personal life (such as in marriage).</li>
                        <li><strong>Relatively Low Work Pressure</strong>: Compared to private enterprises, there is less anxiety about being fired for not meeting performance targets. The housing provident fund benefits are generous, which can effectively alleviate the pressure of buying a house. Work hours are relatively regular, and women do not have to worry about facing workplace discrimination due to childbirth.</li>
                        <li><strong>Good Welfare and Benefits</strong>: The salary is linked to the local economic development level, which is enough to ensure a decent life. In addition, various bonuses and subsidies for holidays are also considerable.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h4>What are the "Cons"?</h4>
                    <p>Everything has two sides, and we must also look at the job of a civil servant rationally.</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Income is Strongly Correlated with the Region</strong>: In economically developed provincial capitals, the income is quite considerable. However, in underdeveloped areas or grassroots townships, the take-home pay might only be three or four thousand yuan, and overtime at the grassroots level often goes unpaid.</li>
                        <li><strong>Strict Restrictions on Part-time Jobs</strong>: There are strict restrictions on civil servants engaging in side businesses. For example, you can earn legal income through personal creation (such as painting or writing) on social media, but you must not accept advertisements or sell goods, as this represents the government's image. Part-time teaching or partnering with others to open a shop is also generally not allowed to prevent the risk of receiving gifts in disguise. If you want to be a civil servant, you must learn to be self-disciplined and incorruptible.</li>
                        <li><strong>Relatively Slow Career Development</strong>: Nearly 80% of civil servant positions are at the grassroots level. Promotion from the grassroots level takes at least three years and depends on work performance. Although those with outstanding achievements can be promoted, making achievements is not easy. Moving up through transfers or selections depends on personal connections for the former, and for the latter, you need to meet the service year requirements, pass a new round of exams, and have a bit of luck. For most people, the path to promotion is a matter of "endurance."</li>
                        <li><strong>Heavy Workload at the Grassroots Level</strong>: 90% of policies are ultimately implemented at the grassroots level. Under key tasks such as poverty alleviation and rural revitalization, overtime is the norm for grassroots civil servants. The situation is slightly better in developed areas, but correspondingly, the difficulty of obtaining these positions increases exponentially.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h3>Are You Suited for the Civil Service Exam?</h3>
                    <p>Taking the civil service exam is like a besieged fortress: those outside want to get in, and those inside want to get out. Before choosing this path, be sure to ask yourself.</p>
                    <p><strong>Who is this path suitable for?</strong></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>People who single-mindedly pursue a stable life.</li>
                        <li>People with political ideals and ambitions.</li>
                        <li>People who hope to return to their hometown to work but find limited local employment opportunities.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p><strong>Who might this path not be suitable for?</strong></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>People who are eager to make a lot of money and achieve financial freedom.</li>
                        <li>People with strong personalities who dislike being constrained by rules and regulations. There are many rules within the system, and it is easy to cross red lines.</li>
                        <li>People with outstanding abilities and skills. In regular civil servant positions, your talents may be difficult to display, which can easily lead to a sense of frustration.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Before making a decision, please think carefully: What do I want? Can taking the civil service exam meet my needs? After I pass, what will my life goals be? Avoid embarking on a path shrouded in fog.</p>
                    <h3>How to Prepare Efficiently?</h3>
                    <p>If you have determined that the civil service exam is the right path for you, then the next step is to prepare with all your might.</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li><strong>Start Preparing Early</strong>: If you are still a student, it is recommended to start preparing in your junior year, as you can take the national exam in the first semester of your senior year.</li>
                        <li><strong>Understand the Exam</strong>: The national exam is usually held in November-December each year, while provincial exams are mostly in the spring. The subjects are the "Administrative Aptitude Test" and "Essay Writing." Although the subjects are the same, the volume and focus of questions differ between the national exam, provincial exams, and among different provinces. It is recommended to buy targeted preparation books.</li>
                        <li><strong>Preparation Strategy</strong>:
                            <ul>
                                <li><strong>Administrative Aptitude Test</strong>: Time is extremely tight, and almost no one can finish it. The strategy is to "get all the questions you know right, and guess decisively on those you don't," without wasting time on difficult questions.</li>
                                <li><strong>Essay Writing</strong>: This tests reading, analysis, and writing skills, especially applied official document writing. It requires a lot of practice and accumulation of current affairs materials and famous quotes.</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li><strong>Learning Resources</strong>: Attending a training course is one of the most efficient methods, allowing you to learn systematically. If you choose to study on your own, it is a great test of self-discipline.</li>
                        <li><strong>Scientific Position Selection</strong>: "Choosing the right position is better than scoring high." Position selection is a key step. Generally, the more restrictive the conditions for a position, the less competition there is. You need to carefully study the job list to make the most advantageous choice.</li>
                    </ol>
                    <p>Finally, I wish every student who chooses this path can successfully cross the single-plank bridge and get in!</p>
                    <p>Alright, that's all for today's topic on the civil service exam. The next session will be even more exciting, so be sure to tune in! Goodbye!</p>
